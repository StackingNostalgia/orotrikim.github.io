    <p> The FIRST challenge for this year was called Rebound Rumble.  The challenge included throwing foam basketballs into hoops at various heights.  Additional points could be earned by balancing on a see-saw like bridge. For more information, see the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13HpbFjZWto"> official game animation.</a></p>
    <h5>Design</h5>
    <p>The 2012 robot had a tiny frame. This design was chosen because of its ability to complete the Coopertition Challenge and balance on the bridge easier. It was also a skinnier robot because the maximum dimension size was based on the addition of width and length. Choosing to make a wider chassis resulted in the robot frame to be shorter. The robot featured a 4 wheel arcade drive. After the first competition, we added“training wheels” to prevent rolling.</p>
    <h5>Throwing</h5>
    <p> To throw the basketball, a system was created with 6 CIM Motor with a few window motors. The basketball was placed between 4 wheels, 2 on each axle, which was connected to a motor.  To shoot the different height hoops, the power of the motor was adjusted.</p>
    <h5>Intake</h5>
    <p> Surgical tubing with zip ties horizontally to intake balls and transfer them to an elevator system. Left-most image shows this system.</p>
