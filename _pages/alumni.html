I was given access to so many opportunities for college and my career. When I think of what experiences have made me the person I am today, being on 1418 is at the top of that list, absolutely without a doubt." </blockquote><p> — Erik Boesen '19</p>
        <blockquote>"1418 was how I originally gained numerous skills that I use every day today. This includes both technical skills -- machining, soldering, electronics, designing, building...technical drawing, computer programming, vector math, etc. etc. etc. -- and also soft skills -- teamwork, problem solving, project planning, work ethic, leadership, working under pressure, staying focused, learning new skills fast, prioritizing work when you have limited resources, [and] bouncing back from failure." </blockquote><p> — Rachel Taylor '07</p>
